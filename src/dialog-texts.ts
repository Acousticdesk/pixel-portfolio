He established communication between our team and five external teams to make sure we all collaborate efficiently and as a team.\n\nAndrii always takes participation in active discussion when it comes to feature implementation or code refactoring to make sure that every requirement is taken into account and everything is feasible before diving into the implementation phase.\n\nAndrii's versatility helped a lot during the implementation phase of the project when needed to work on a hybrid application which involves web stack technologies, native mobile apps deployment strategies and cloud based API.",
